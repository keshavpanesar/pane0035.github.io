    <h2>About me</h2>
    <a>
        My name is Keshav Singh Panesar, but my parents like to call me Anmol. <br>
        I am studying Interactive media design in Algonquin College for <br>
        spring 2022. I am from Patiala, Punjab, India (The royal city of Punjab) <br>
        I completed my 12<sup>th</sup> grade from C.B.S.E., India, majoring in maths,<br>
        psychology and sociology. My overall percentage for my 12<sup>th</sup> was 86%<br>
        My hobbies are: <ul>
            <li>Photography</li>
            <li>Videography</li>
            <li>Cooking Food(for myself)
            <li>Exploring the work of people on Behance</li>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        In India I worked for a NGO <abbr title="Yuva Pariwar Sewa Samiti">YPSS</abbr> as a photographer and videographer in drug <br>
        eradication event which were organized in the states of Punjab,<br>
        Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. By grace of god being 17 years old, I <br>
        got a chance to shoot as main cameraman in Haryana for a <strong>Bollywood</strong> <br>
        <strong> movie.</strong> <em>This experience helped me in gaining knowledge about <br>
        filmmaking and in depth.</em> Now I am capable of using a cinema camera <br>
        and setup it up myself and do scripting and storyboards. <br>
